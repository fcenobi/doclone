1	INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Description
Doclone is a free project developed in C++ for creating and restoring backups of
a disk or partition. It also is possible to work over the network, sending the
images through the network to its recipients, or on the fly, by sending the
device data directly over the network.

1.2 Supported filesystems
Doclone uses libblkid for detect te filesystems, and some external tools for
format them. The management of the fs labels and uuid's is the responsibility of
the libparted library.

Here's a list of the supported file systems, and the needed libraries and tools
for formating or mounting it.

Filesystem        	Needed software
ext2                    mke2fs
ext3                    mke2fs
ext4			mke2fs
fat16                   mkdosfs
fat32                   mkdosfs
hfs                     mkfs.hfs
hfs+                    mkfs.hfsplus
jfs                     jfs_mkfs
linux-swap              mkswap
ntfs                    mkntfs
reiserfs                mkreiserfs
xfs                     mkfs.xfs

It is not necessary to have all tools avobe for work, but it is necessary to
have the apropriate tool for the filesystems on which doclone will work.

1.4 Required Software
It is necessary to have the library libparted 3.2 or later installed. The
libraries libe2fs, libuuid, libblkid, libarchive, libxerces-c and liblog4cpp
also required.

1.5 Compliling doclone
As usual, to compile doclone you only have to execute the classic commands:

    ./configure
    make
   
And if you wish to install it on your system, execute as root:

    make install

Before compile, is necessary to make sure you have the folowwing development
libraries:

- libparted-dev
- e2fslibs-dev
- uuid-dev
- libblkid-dev
- libarchive-dev
- libxerces-c-dev
- liblog4cpp-dev

1.6 Supported Platforms
Currently, doclone has been compiled only in GNU/Linux

2	USING DOCLONE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Local Use
Local use of doclone is limited to creating images of a disk or partition, or
restoring images created previously on a disk or partition.

2.2 Network use
Doclone lets you work over the internet. By this way, it allows you to restore
images created on another computer. For this purpose, is possible to work in two
modes, the Unicast/Multicast and the Chain Mode.

2.2.1 Unicast/Multicast
In this mode, there is one server and one or more clients. The server must run
before and wait for the clients. Then, the clients can connect with the server,
who send them its data.

2.2.2 Chain Mode
This mode creates a chain of computers, like a bus-topoligy network where every
node send the data to the next one in the chain. In this mode, the clients run
before and the server sends a broadcast package to know who is listening. Then,
sorts the chain and sends to each client the IP address of the next one.

2.3 Command line options.
Here is detailed more thoroughly how to use doclone.

Synopsis:
        doclone FUNCTION [ -d, --device DEVICE ] [ -f, --file FILE ]
		[ -a, --address SERVER-IP-ADDRESS ] [ -n, --nodes NUMBER ]
		[ -i, --interface IP-OF-WORKING-INTERFACE]
		[ -e, --empty ] [ -F, --force]

Arguments:
-d, --device		The device you are going to use. Examples: "/dev/sda", "/dev/sdb2"
-f, --file		The file you are going to create or read. Example: "~/backups/hda.doclone"
-a, --address 		IP address you are going to contact. Example: "192.168.1.3"
-n, --nodes		The number of receivers in multicast mode.
-i, --interface		The network interface for network modes.

OPTIONS:

-e, --empty      Saves in the image only the partition table, with no data.
                    It can be used both locally and networking.
                    
    				Example:
    				doclone -cd /dev/sda -f ~/sda-empty.doclone -e
  
-F, --force		Restores the image even if the datat doesn't fit in the target device.
                    It can be used both locally and networking.
                    It only haves effect if you are restoring an image.
                    
    				Example:
    				doclone -rd /dev/sda -f ~/sda.doclone -F

FUNCTIONS:
For local use:
All of these options must be used with -d and -f. In all cases the order of the
parameters is irrelevant.

-c, --create        Create an image of a disk or partition.
					Examples:
					doclone -cd /dev/sda -f ~/backups/sda.doclone
					doclone -cd /dev/sda2 -f ~/backups/sda2.doclone
   
-r, --restore		Restore an image to a disk or partition.
					Examples:
					doclone -rf ~/backups/sda.doclone -d /dev/sda
					doclone -rf ~/backups/sda2.doclone -d /dev/sda2

Network Use:
All the network options need the use of -f or -d. Depending on whether what you 
want to send or receive is an image or a device.

Unicast/Multicast:
-S, --send			Send the data (the option involves -n)
					Example:
					doclone -Sd /dev/sda -n 1
    				Send the contents of /dev/sda to one receiver.
    				
    				If the -n option is not specified, the number of receivers
    				is set to 1 by default
   
-C, --receive		Receive the data of the server
					Example:
					doclone -Rd /dev/sda -a 192.168.1.150
					Receive information from 192.168.1.150 and save it in /dev/sda.

					Example:
					doclone -Rf ~/backups/sda.doclone
					Receive information from 192.168.1.150 and save in ~/backups/sda.doclone
					(By this way you can create remote images).
   
Chain Mode connection:
-s, --link-send		Send the data to the network.
    				Example:
    				doclone -sd /dev/sda
    				Send the data of /dev/sda to the chain.
   
-l, --link-receive	Receive the data from the network
					Example:
					doclone -ld /dev/sda
					It gets data from the chain and restores it in /dev/sda

					Example:
					doclone -lf ~/backups/sda.doclone
					Receive the data from the chain and save it in in a image file.

3	AFTER USING DOCLONE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 The boot sector
When you decide to create an image of an entire hard disk, the boot sector is
also saved. This means if you have installed the GRUB bootloader, it will be
cloned as well as all of its options to the receiving machine. If the origin
machine has no GRUB, the first 446 bytes of the disk will be cloned "as is".

3.2 Partitions
It is possible to create an image of a 40GB hard disk in the server, but
afterwardsis necessary to restore it  in a 20GB hard disk (for example). This
is not a problem for doclone, the program saves only your files in the image,
so if your files only takes 10GB, the image will be restored without problems.
Additionally, the partitions adjust to the proportion they occupied in the
original, which is to say, if you have a partition that takes the 70% of a
40GB disk, on the client the partition will take the 70% of the 20GB disk, so
long as your files can fit on that space, in other case doclone will return an
error. If the original disk is smaller than the destination, the partitions
will increase proportionally.
