/**
 * \class Logger
 * \brief The logger class of the project. Singleton pattern.
 *
 * This class is used to write the traces of the execution of the program,
 * and showing the messages of the exceptions.
 *
 * It uses the library log4cpp for this purpose, and implements six levels of
 * messages:
 *
 * FATAL: Some function has made a big mistake. Currently unused.
 * ERROR: Some Error happened and the program cannot continue.
 * WARNING: Some Error happened but the program can control it and continue
 *  working.
 * INFO: Some useful info for the user. Currently unused.
 * DEBUG: Traces the thread of execution of the program, each function inform
 *  trough this level when it starts o ends. Only if the programmer compiles the
 *  code with the -DDEBUG_LOG flag.
 * LOOP DEBUG: Same as above, but there are some functions that are executed
 *  from a loop and can be called hundreds of times. This kind of messages
 *  really bother. For see this kind of messages, must compile with the
 *  -DDEBUG_LOOP flag.
 *
 * This class also implements a backtrace for the exceptions of the program. All
 * exceptions are written in a vector, and there is a function to get it.
 *
