/**
 * \defgroup Filesystems Supported Filesystems
 * \brief List of supported Filesystems
 *
 * The program support many filesystems with varying levels of compatibility.
 *
 * For each Fs, there is a function called checkSupport that checks if the
 * system has installed the tools or libraries needed to mount, format,
 * read/write fs label and read/write fs uuid.
 *
 * Each object of Partition class has a private pointer to FileSystem class
 * called _fs. This pointer is initialized through the class FsFactory, with a
 * function that receives a string with the name of an fs and returns a pointer
 * to an object with the right type. There is also an overload of this function
 * that receives the TYPE tag of blkid to build the objects.
 *
 * There are two kinds of filesystems, represented as inheritances of FileSystem
 * class: UnixFS and DosFS. Each of these classes have children classes, one for
 * filesystem.
 *
 * The difference between these two classes is only the kind of file types used.
 * An Unix file can be a regular file, a hard link, soft link, device, etc. And
 * a DOS file can only be a file or a directory. In addition, doclone currently
 * does not support the cloning of the attributes of a DOS kind file.
