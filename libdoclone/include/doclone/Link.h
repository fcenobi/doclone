/**
 * \class Link
 * \brief Implementation of the link mode.
 *
 * Methods and attributes to clone over network using the link mode.
 *
 * In the link mode, there are two kinds of actors, the sender and the
 * receivers.
 *
 * The nodes are arranged in a single line, like a hub, each one receives
 * the data of the previous one in the chain, sending it to he next one.
 *
 * The receivers must run first. Then the sender sends an UDP message and wait
 * for responses. Each response is a link that is waiting for data. Here, the
 * sender sends to each receiver the IP of the next node in the chain to form
 * the network.
 *
 * Class inherited from Net.
