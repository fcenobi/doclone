 *
 * This library handles some potential problems that may arise during execution.
 * These problems can be mild or severe, mild problems extend WarningException,
 * and the severe problem extend ErrorException class.
 *
 * The serious problems stop execution. The light errors can be controlled
 * and the execution can continue.
 *
 * The program has a backtrace, located in the class Logger, recording all
 * errors that occurred.
 *
 * It allows the library user to decide what to do with error messages.
 * Although in any case, messages always be notified to the views when they
 * occur.
