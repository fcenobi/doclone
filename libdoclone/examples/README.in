One of them is written on C and the other in C++, using the C and C++ API of
libdoclone respectively.

How to compile them:

		- doclone.c:
			gcc -o doclone_c doclone.c -ldoclone
			
		- doclone.cc:
			g++ -o doclone_cc doclone.cc -ldoclone


Using the C and C++ APIs:
You can read more details about the using of the libdoclone APIs either in the
README file in the @prefix@/share/doc/@PACKAGE_TARNAME@ directory, or in the
home page of the project: http://doclone.nongnu.org/#libdocs
